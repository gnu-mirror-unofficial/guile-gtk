    <h2>(cons 'guile 'gtk)</h2>

    <p>
     Guile-Gtk brings the power of Scheme to your graphical application.
     Create windows and dialogs, interact with the user, even draw directly
     with Gdk primitives, all from Scheme code.
    </p>

    <p>
     Guile-Gtk wraps Gtk 2.0 and up (or Guile-Gtk version 0.60 was the last to
     support Gtk 1.2).

    <p>
     The present status is "works very nicely so far as it goes", but not
     getting actively worked.  For new applications or new work it's strongly
     recommended you use <a href="../../software/guile-gnome">Guile-Gnome</a>
     instead.  Guile-Gnome has surpassed Guile-Gtk by a big margin, with a
     much fuller set of bindings for Gtk, Gnome, and related projects, and a
     much more flexible way to keep up with new things in Gtk and to wrap
     other libraries.

     site has gotten a much-needed overhaul. Scheme hackers, rejoice!
