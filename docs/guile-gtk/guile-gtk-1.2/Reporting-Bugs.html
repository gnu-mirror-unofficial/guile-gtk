<h2 class="chapter">Reporting Bugs</h2>

   <p>If you think you've found a bug in Guile-Gtk, please investigate and make a
full report.  Include the following in any report,

     <ul>
<li>System and CPU type, obtained from running <code>./config.guess</code> (or
<code>uname -a</code> if your system is unknown).

     <li>The versions of Guile-Gtk, Guile, Gtk and Glib, the configuration options
used, and if patched or packaged then say so.

     <li>The build compiler and its version.

     <li>A test program illustrating the problem.  Describe how to run it, what it
does, and what you think it should do.

     <li>If you get a Scheme level error, include the backtrace obtained from running
with <code>guile --debug</code>.

     <li>If you get a C level crash, try running under the debugger and include a
backtrace (<code>where</code> in GDB) if it's informative.

     <li>If the bug is related to <code>./configure</code>, then send the contents of
<code>config.log</code>. 
</ul>
