<h2 class="chapter">Installing</h2>

   <p>To build and install Guile-Gtk you will need Guile 1.6.4 or higher, and Glib
and Gtk versions 1.2.x (1.2.10 for instance).  Gdk-Pixbuf, Glade and Gtk-GL
are optional, support for them will be included if they're available.

   <p>Guile-Gtk uses an Autoconf, Automake and Libtool based configuration system. 
A basic build can be made with,

<pre class="example">     ./configure
     make
     </pre>

<p>Some self-tests can be run with

<pre class="example">     make check
     </pre>

<p>And you can install (under <code>/usr/local</code> by default) with

<pre class="example">     make install
     </pre>

   <p>The file <code>INSTALL</code> has generic information about <code>./configure</code>. 
Running <code>./configure --help</code> will print a summary of the usage and
options.

   <p>Installing under the same <code>--prefix</code> as Guile will make Guile Gtk
available immediately.  If installed under a different tree it will be
necessary to add to <code>%load-path</code> and possibly <code>LTDL_LIBRARY_PATH</code> so
the modules and interface libraries can be found.

   <p>The following Guile-Gtk specific options are available.

     <dl>
<dt><code>--with-gdk-pixbuf=yes/no</code>
     <dd><dt><code>--with-libglade=yes/no</code>
     <dd><dt><code>--with-gtkgl=yes/no</code>
     <dd>Enable or disable Gdk-Pixbuf, Glade, or Gtk-GL support, respectively.  The
default for each is to enable if available. 
</dl>
