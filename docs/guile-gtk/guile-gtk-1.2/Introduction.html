<h2 class="chapter">Introduction</h2>

   <p>Guile-Gtk makes the Gtk+, Gdk Pixbuf, Glade and Gtk GL graphical user
interface libraries available from within Guile.  (see <a href="../guile/index.html#Top">The Guile Reference Manual</a>)

   <p>This manual makes no attempt to document those libraries, only how to use them
from Guile.

   <p>Currently, Guile-Gtk supports Gtk version 1.2, and versions of Gdk-Pixbuf,
Glade and Gtk-GL corresponding to that.  Gtk 2.0 and Gnome will be supported
by a new line of development, available as Guile-Gobject on the Guile-Gtk home
page.

   <p>The Guile-Gtk home page is at the following URL.  A mailing list for users and
developers is available, see the home page for details.

   <p>As a taste of Guile-Gtk style, here is a hello world program.  Those familiar
with Gtk should find it straightforward.  A toplevel window is created, a
label widget added, the result realized, and a main loop run.

<pre class="example">     (use-modules (gtk-1.2 gtk))
     
     (define top (gtk-window-new 'toplevel))
     (gtk-signal-connect top "destroy" gtk-exit)
     
     (define label (gtk-label-new " Hello world! "))
     (gtk-container-add top label)
     
     (gtk-widget-show-all top)
     (gtk-main)
     </pre>
