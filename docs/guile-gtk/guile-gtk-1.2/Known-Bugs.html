<dt><code>gdk-colormap-alloc-color</code><dt><code>gdk-colormap-alloc-colors</code><dd>In Gtk 1.2.10, <code>gdk_colormap_alloc_color</code> and
<code>gdk_colormap_alloc_colors</code> have bugs in allocating writable colours from
a shared (ie. non-private) colormap in a pseudocolor visual.  The success
flags and failcount returned indicate failure even when the operation
succeeds.

     <p>Guile Gtk makes no attempt to do anything about this.  The only suggestion
would be for an application to check for a change in the <code>pixel</code> fields
of the <code>GdkColor</code> objects, since this ends up being done only on success.

     <br><dt><code>GdkPixmap</code>, <code>GdkBitmap</code><dd>Pixmaps and bitmaps are not properly freed when garbage collected.  A warning
is printed about an undestroyed window reaching a zero reference count, and
the underlying X server object is not freed.

     <p>This is due to those objects being dereferenced with <code>gdk_window_unref</code>
instead of <code>gdk_pixmap_unref</code>.  Although <code>GdkPixmap</code> and
<code>GdkWindow</code> are the same pointer type (in Gtk 1.2), the unref functions
are not the same.  Guile Gtk will need to represent them as distinct classes,
and allow both in functions taking <code>GdkDrawable</code>.  (Distinct classes will
also have the happy effect of stronger checking for instance in
<code>gdk-window-map</code> which should reject a <code>GdkPixmap</code>.)

     <br><dt><code>GtkEditable</code> <code>insert-text</code> signal<dd>The callback for the <code>insert-text</code> signal from a <code>GtkEditable</code>
doesn't respect the length for the new text, and doesn't provide a means to
modify the position (which is an in/out parameter).

     <p>This may change in the future, probably to a single string parameter for the
text and some sort of modifiable location for the position (a one element
vector perhaps). 
<!-- For reference, the special handling of pointer+length for the string -->
<!-- either needs to be in sgtk_callback_marshall, or some special marshaller -->
<!-- when connecting insert-text. -->
<!-- sgtk_callback_marshall doesn't get the signal name, but testing for -->
<!-- GtkEditable (or a sub-class) getting string+int+pointer might be close -->
<!-- enough.  Alternately, set a flag in sgtk_protshell to say when special -->
<!-- insert-text handling is needed. -->
