<h2 class="chapter">Example Programs</h2>

   <p>The <code>examples</code> subdirectory in the sources contains various programs
illustrating Guile Gtk.

     <dl>
<dt><code>calc.scm</code>
     <dd>A HP48 style desk calculator.  This takes quite a bit of code to setup all the
widgets, but there's plenty of comments.

     <p>A <code>.calcrc</code> in the user's home directory can add new buttons.  The
ability to load user extensions is a powerful feature and a significant
advantage Guile Gtk has over the regular C interface to Gtk.

     <br><dt><code>calendar.scm</code>
     <dd>A tiny program showing the <code>GtkCalendar</code> widget.

     <br><dt><code>clist.scm</code>
     <dd>Display the password file in a window.  (You might need to enlarge the window
manually.)

     <br><dt><code>continuations.scm</code>
     <dd>Illustrate the use of Scheme continuations to allow application code to wait
for a dialog to return, but in fact run the usual Gtk main loop.

     <br><dt><code>hello-world.scm</code>
     <dd>A simple program creating a button which can be pressed to print a familiar
message.

     <br><dt><code>metaspline.scm</code>
     <dd>A Metafont style bezier spline curve editor, using the Gdk drawing primitives.

     <br><dt><code>simple.scm</code>
     <dd>A simple program with a label and a button.

     <br><dt><code>simple.glade</code>, <code>run-glade.scm</code>
     <dd>A simple Glade application.  Notice the use of <code>lambda</code> forms in the
signal handlers.  <code>run-glade.scm</code> loads and runs a glade application, for
instance

     <pre class="example">          guile -s run-glade.scm simple.glade
          </pre>

     <br><dt><code>test-dnd.scm</code>
     <dd><dt><code>test-gdk.scm</code>
     <dd><dt><code>test-glade.scm</code>
     <dd><dt><code>test-gtk.scm</code>
     <dd>Test programs for drag-and-drop, Gdk, Glade and Gtk respectively.  These are
primarily for the developers' use, but can be run to see something happen and
to test Guile Gtk is working.

     <br><dt><code>tictactoe.scm</code>
     <dd>Illustrate the use of <code>gtk-class-new</code> to create a tic-tac-toe widget. 
There's no actual "X" and "O" markers, only three squares in a row
recognised as a win.
