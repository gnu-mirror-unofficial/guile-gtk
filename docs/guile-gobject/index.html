    <h2>guile-gobject documentation</h2>

    <h3><a href="gobject/">The GLib type system</a></h3>
    <p>
     An in-depth discussion of how guile-gobject wraps GLib's type system,
     making it possible to interact with arbitrary types. Concludes with a
     longer example of how to derive your own object types.
    </p>

    <h3><a href="gtk/">Gtk, Gdk, Pango, Atk</a></h3>
    <p>
     Using the Gtk+ bindings to create graphical applications. Also briefly
     covers use of the supporting libraries: Gdk, Pango, and Atk.
    </p>

    <h3><a href="corba/">CORBA</a></h3>
    <p>
     How to access CORBA from Scheme :-)
    </p>

    <h3><a href="defs-support/">Generating your own bindings</a></h3>
    <p>
     Using g-wrap and the <code>.defs</code> translator to create your own
     bindings.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="history">History</a></h3>
    <p>
     The guile-gobject project was actually one of the very first bindings for
     the fledgeling GLib type system, back in 2001 when GLib was in its 1.3.x
     phase. It was developed by Martin Baulig, who pursued the project with
     obsession. So much so, that he left it with this note:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     Today, I mean yesterday - it's already past midnight - was my last day of
     GNOME 2 hacking for the next four months. Hacking on GNOME was so much fun
     for me - but now I need to concentrate on my real life and learn for the
     university.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
     Hackers beware! Not heeding the warning, Ariel Rios stepped in to steward
     the project through its teething phases. The GObject wrapper that exists
     today was primarily written by Martin, however; his successors' jobs have
     been made much easier because of his high-quality code.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nothing much happened on the code base until early 2003, when Andy Wingo
     took an interest in accessing GObject-based APIs with guile. He is the
     current maintainer, and his principal contribution has been the binding
     generator, as well as bugfixes. He also maintains the GStreamer bindings,
     <a href="http://gstreamer.net/bindings/guile/"><code>gst-guile</code></a>.
    </p>

      Although they were released almost two years ago, Martin Baulig's
      notes on the first guile-gobject release are still relevant today.
     </dd>
     <dt><a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/project/guile-gtk/">0.5.0 release notes</a></dt>
     <dd>
      An acceptable introduction to the binding generator, with some examples.
      Also introduces the use of generic functions, as well as the Gtk bindings.
